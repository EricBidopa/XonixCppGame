## README

This code is an implementation of the classic arcade game Xonix. 
The player controls a character that moves around the screen,
 attempting to capture as much territory as possible by creating boundaries while avoiding enemies.

The game is written in C++ using the SFML library. 
It features a simple graphical user interface with images 
for the tiles, game over, and enemies.

The game involves the player moving the character using the
 arrow keys to capture a certain percentage of the game board 
 while avoiding the enemies. If an enemy collides with the character, 
 the game is over. The player can create boundaries by moving the character, 
 and when the boundaries enclose an area, that area is captured. The game ends 
 when the player has captured the required percentage of the board or when 
 the player collides with an enemy.

This implementation of Xonix is a small-scale game, but it can be expanded upon
 and modified to suit the developer's needs. Feel free to use and modify the code according to your requirements.


To run the code, you need to have the SFML library installed on your computer.
 Once you have installed the library, you can compile and run the code using a C++ compiler, such as g++.
